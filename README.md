# STA145 Project Final Project
My replication project for STA-145, is a look at the the United States House of Representatives and see if their is a pattern between the a House members political party and if that has a impact on if those said members had prior elected positions. This is because I am interested in seeing if the 2024 election has had a noticable impact in party makeup, and if one party or another had a noticable preference for new repersenatitives.  

# Instructions
To access and utilize the script, open the "Englisa-final_project.R" File, which contains the code for the project. To access the datasheet, open "data.csv" file. 

# Data
The data collected for this project was several different qualitiative and quanitative variables. The main gaol was to reveal key information on House members backgrounds, in hoping to find a pattern amongst the two political parties, in order to see trends or biases in them. The gathered information was used to compile the information found into several categories such as age, party affiliation, and wealth, among other variables. These variables where then used to determine to see if there was any noticable differents between the two parties members. 

# Operationalization
To operalization the House of Repersentatives members, my project group went to several government websites in order to collect the data concerning to variables that were found to be of import. 

The concept of political party was operationalized by going through the House of Repersentatives website, and compiling a list of which party the House members fell into. Republican members or affilates were labeled '1'. Democrat members or affilates were labeld '2'. 

The concept of previous exprience was operationalized by going through several government websites and finding out if repersentatives have any prior official elected positions on record. Those repersentatives that did were labeled '1'. Those repersenatives that did not were labeled '2'.
